The main.js.map file is a source map that maps the minified code in main.js back to the original source code before minification. It includes details like original file names, variable names, and code structure.
With the source map, you can "unminify" or reconstruct a more readable version of the original source code, including the React components, directory structure, and sometimes even comments (if they were included in the build).

Security Implications (Pentesting Context):
Exposing main.js and main.js.map in a production environment is a security misconfiguration. It can reveal sensitive information, such as:
Internal logic of the application.
API endpoints, keys, or tokens hardcoded in the code (if not properly secured).
Developer comments or debugging information.
Potential vulnerabilities in the code (e.g., insecure handling of user inputs).

Open Chrome/Firefox DevTools, load the main.js file, and it will automatically use the source map to display the original source code in the "Sources" tab.
You can browse the folder structure and view individual React component files.


Ensure .map files are not deployed to the production server.

With main.js and main.js.map, you can reconstruct a significant portion of the React applicationâ€™s frontend code, including components, logic, and structure, using source map tools or browser DevTools. This is a valuable finding in a pentest, as it highlights a misconfiguration that could expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities. However, you cannot recover backend code or non-bundled assets
